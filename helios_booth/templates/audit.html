<h3>Audit your ballot: </h3>


<p>
<b>HOW?</b> 
  <ol>
  <li>Select your ballot audit info by clicking <a onclick="$('#audit_trail').select(); return false;" href="#">here</a> </li>

  <li>copy the info to your clipboard (right-mouse click+Copy OR CTRL+C)</li>
 
  <li>use the <a target="_blank" href="single-ballot-verify.html?election_url={$T.election_url}">ballot verifier</a> to verify the info.</li>
  </ol>
  
Once you're satisfied, click the "back to voting" button to re-encrypt your vote. You can then choose to cast your vote or verify it again. Before you go back to the voting system you can also post your ballot to the ballot tracking center. 
</p>

<form action="#">
  <textarea name="audit_trail" id="audit_trail" cols="80" rows="10" wrap="soft">
    {$T.audit_trail}

<div style="float: left; background: lightyellow; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; padding: 10px 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd; width:200px;">
  <b><font size="5"> Post vote </b></font> </a> <span style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #444">[Optional]</span>
      <p>
       Before going back to voting,<br />
  you can post this verified vote to the Helios tracking center so that others might double-check the verification of this vote.
      </p>
      <p>
	<b>Even if you post your verified vote, you must go back to voting and choose "Submit vote" if you want your vote to count.</b>
      </p>

      <input type="button" value="Post Ballot" onclick="$(this).attr('disabled', 'disabled');BOOTH.post_audited_ballot();" id="post_audited_ballot_button" class="pretty" />
  </div>

  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />

<p>
  <b><u>IMPORTANT</u></b>: this ballot, now that it has been verified, <em>can not be counted</em>.
  <br />
  To cast a vote, you must click the "Back to Voting" button below, re-encryption is done automatically, and choose "Submit Vote" instead of "Verify Encryption".
</p>
<p>
  <b>Why re-encryption?</b> By performing an audit your encryption as well as the randomness is made public, this means people can figure out your vote. Therefore a new encryption has to be made.
